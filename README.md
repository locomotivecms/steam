The rendering stack used by both Wagon and Engine (WIP). It includes:

- the rack stack to serve assets (SCSS, Coffeescript, ...etc) and pages
- the liquid drops/filters/tags libs to parse and render liquid templates
- a filesystem repository which reads the source of a site written for Wagon

**Note:** Steam passes all the specifications from Wagon.
